# This example was produced using chatGPT
# In this example, the Dash program reads data from a CSV file called data.csv using the Pandas library. Then it creates a Plotly graph with the data and adds it to the layout along with two buttons, start and stop button. The callback function is triggered when either button is clicked. The start button is used to display the graph while the stop button is used to clear the graph. The layout of the graph is set to display the title 'Data from CSV file'.
# It's worth mentioning that this is just an example, you may need to adjust it according to your specific requirements and data structure.
# Please make sure to have the necessary libraries installed before running the program.
